1)java does not make use of pointers.
2)modulus operator here can be used for floating point values also.
3)for(int x=2;;)-> x is valid till scope of for loop only.
4)this keyword se same parameter and same variable name can be used -> this.bed=bed;
5)call  by refernce is done through objects.
6)methods of same class can be used without objects.
7)this and super can't be used with static variables.
8)static things can be accessed without the creation of objects.
9)Outside of the class in which they are defined, static methods and variables can be used
independently of any object. To do so, you need only specify the name of their class followed
by the dot operator.
10)enclosing class does not have access to the members of the nested class.
11)
There are two types of nested classes: static and non-static. A static nested class is one
that has the static modifier applied. Because it is static, it must access the members of its
enclosing class through an object. That is, it cannot refer to members of its enclosing class
directly. Because of this restriction, static nested classes are seldom used.
The most important type of nested class is the inner class. An inner class is a non-static
nested class. It has access to all of the variables and methods of its outer class and may refer
to them directly in the same way that other non-static members of the outer class do.
12)
FUNCTION OF OUTER CLASS CAN'T BE ACCESSED IN INNER CLASS  IN ANY WAY(TEST).
13) string.length() and array.length;
14)strings are immutable character at particular cant be altered directly.
